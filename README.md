# Simple Interest Calculator

A simple calculator to compute simple interest based on user input.

## Project Description

This project provides a Bash script that calculates simple interest given the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period. Simple interest is calculated using the formula:

**Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100**

## Features

- User-friendly command-line interface
- Input validation for principal, rate, and time
- Clear output of the calculated simple interest

## Usage

```bash
./simple-interest.sh
```

The script will prompt you to enter:
- **Principal (P)**: The initial amount of money
- **Rate of Interest (R)**: The annual interest rate (in percentage)
- **Time Period (T)**: The time period (in years)

## Example

```
Enter the principal amount: 1000
Enter the rate of interest: 5
Enter the time period in years: 2
Simple Interest: 100
```
